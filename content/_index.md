## ABOUT

We are a team made up of technologists, threat researchers, developers, incident and helpline responders working to defend human rights defendors. We primarily work within East & South East Asia regions. 

Spyware research in the civil society space is currently dominated by a select group of experts with access to closed-source tools and methodologies, creating high barriers to entry for new researchers and responders. This negatively impacts civil societies ability to identify, respond and mitigate spyware globally by enforced bottlenecks. 

We focus on addressing gaps in spyware research, such as our ability to identify threats on Android devices, which   represent 72.04% of the global mobile market share and dominate mobile usage in regions such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa. 

Through our work, we aim to decolonizing and democratizing threat research. Our aims are to build open-source, community-driven solutions that break the current monopoly on spyware research and empower decentralized civic groups to conduct independent investigations.

Our work is not just about technology—it’s about accessibility. By lowering the barriers to forensic investigation, we ensure no journalist, activist, or human-rights defender is left without the technical support they need to protect themselves.

We work closely with our sister organization SecurityMatters, and collaborate with partners such as CDR & OTF.
