## ABOUT

我們是由一個在科技與人權交叉點上工作的駭客活動加、安全研究員、技術員、數位安全從業人員和事件回應者所組成的草根安全研究團隊。

We are a grassroots security research team. A collective of hacktivists, security researchers, technologists, and incident responders working at the intersection of technology and human rights. 

Our mission is to defend and support human rights defenders—particularly in East and Southeast Asia.

Spyware & security research that protects civil society and human rights defenders from surveillance is currently dominated by a small number of organizations with privileged access to information, closed-source tools, and opaque methodologies. Private sector, encroach on our ability to defend ourselves without their proprietary data hoarding technologies. This creates high barriers to entry for local research labs, independent researchers, and responders—reinforcing unhealthy dependencies on Big Tech. These structural bottlenecks limit civil society’s capacity to detect, investigate, and respond to spyware threats at scale.

We exist to challenge that.

Our work fills critical gaps in spyware research, with the goal of enabling localized, decentralized, and public-interest threat labs to emerge around the world. For example, we specialize in threat research on Android devices—which make up over 72% of the global mobile market and are the dominant platforms across Asia, Latin America, and Africa.

Alongside this project, we conduct applied **security research, penetration testing, and malware research (including reverse engineering and analysis)** and hands-on incident response for at-risk communities. These **capabilities directly inform our open methodologies, technologies and strengthen the defensive posture of partners on the ground.**

Through open-source, community-driven tools and methodologies, we aim to decolonize and democratize threat research—pushing for independence from private-sector dominance. We envision a world where civic-led, public-interest investigations thrive, free from centralized control.

All of our tools are built in-house, ensuring full technological sovereignty, transparency, and trust. Nothing is outsourced. Nothing is proprietary. Our team builds everything themselves—for the people, by the people.

Our work goes beyond technology. It’s about **accessibility**. By lowering the barriers to digital forensics and investigation, we ensure that no journalist, activist, or human rights defender is left behind—especially in the Global South.

We collaborate closely with our sister organization, SecurityMatters, and work in partnership with groups such as the Open Culture Foundation and Centre for Digital Resilience.
