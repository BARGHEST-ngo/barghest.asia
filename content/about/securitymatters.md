## About SecurityMatters

We believe that human rights defenders (HRDs) and activists are fundamental to social change around the world. While HRDs and activists fight to make the world a better place, they often do so at significant personal risks. Not all risks are occupational hazards, and that's where we come in!

Providing HRDs and activists with the right security toolkit ensures they are well prepared and well protected to do what they do best. Drive social change!
