## What is MVT-Mesh?

MVT Mesh provides a secure, fast, and scalable way for civil society researchers to remotely access and preserve mobile forensic data, crucial for identifying spyware or malicious implants.

By establishing a software-defined network overlay between a victim's device and a forensic analyst's host, MVT Mesh enables real-time forensic analysis of ephemeral artifacts such as ADB logs, which are often deleted by the device or threat actors. Unlike existing tools that require physical access or complex user interactions, this solution offers a one-click deployment, integrates with existing forensic workflows (like PiRogue & MVT), and lowers the barrier to entry for threat research.

## The Problem We're Solving

Spyware research in the civil society space is currently dominated by a select group of experts with access to closed-source tools and methodologies, creating high barriers to entry for new researchers and responders. This negatively impacts our ability to identify, respond, and mitigate spyware globally by enforced bottlenecks.

Current forensic workflows require physical access to a device or a complex, user-driven artifact extraction process, which is often impractical and time-consuming in high-risk, time-sensitive scenarios where a target cannot safely hand over their phone.

Additionally, existing forensic methodologies are cumbersome, requiring the victim to connect to WebADB over USB and extract artifacts themselves before submitting them for analysis at the lab, where the lab then runs tools like MVT. This process introduces significant friction, making forensic investigations inaccessible to the majority of civil society groups, independent researchers, and smaller organizations without in-house expertise. As a result, spyware detection and response efforts are bottlenecked by limited resources, leaving many victims without the technical support they need.

MVT Mesh directly addresses these challenges by providing a secure, remote forensic access solution designed for civil society organizations and threat researchers. Unlike existing methods that rely on physical handover or complex user-driven extraction, MVT Mesh leverages a software-defined networking approach to enable real-time forensic investigation without requiring direct user interaction.

By implementing a self-hosted open-source network relay infrastructure using Headscale and WireGuard, forensic analysts will be able to securely tunnel into a mobile device as if it were on the same local network and leverage technology such as Android Debug Bridge over TCP to perform remote artifact extraction and heuristic detections.

### MVT Mesh solves these issues by:

1. Automating forensic data collection through an encrypted, software-defined network overlay that links a target’s phone directly with an analyst’s forensic host.
2. Providing a single-app installation for victims, requiring minimal interaction beyond pairing the forensic analyst with the device.
3. Eliminating the need for physical handover and providing real-time access to volatile forensic evidence before it is deleted.
4. Integrating with network monitoring tools like PiRogue, enabling forensic teams to remotely capture network traffic without requiring users to configure WireGuard manually.
5. Operating through a mesh VPN, which allows the app to block all non-forensic traffic, limiting spyware/malware’s ability to communicate during and after a forensic session.

## How MVT-Mesh Makes a Difference

### Similar Projects:

- **Tailscale (Proprietary)** – A commercial VPN overlay based on WireGuard. While open-source clients exist, the control plane is closed-source and not designed for forensic workflows.
- **PiRogue** – A portable network monitoring toolkit used for spyware research but requires manual WireGuard configuration, making it inaccessible to many civil society responders.
- **WebADB Solutions (Closed-Source)** – A forensic workflow that allows a victim to connect via WebADB and manually extract forensic artifacts.

### How MVT Mesh is Different:

1. **Fully Open-Source** – Unlike Tailscale, which is closed-source, MVT Mesh leverages a custom-built client that will be fully open-source & a relay infrastructure using Headscale.
2. **Optimized for Digital Forensics** – Unlike general-purpose VPNs, MVT Mesh is designed specifically to support spyware investigations and forensic workflows.
3. **Seamless PiRogue Integration** – No need for manual WireGuard setup; traffic automatically routes through a forensic analyst’s PiRogue instance.
4. **Seamless MVT Integration** – No need for analysts to recover data from a victim to then run MVT locally. MVT Mesh will allow Android ADB bridging remotely.
5. **One-Click Deployment** – The victim installs a single app, and the forensic analyst immediately gains remote forensic access.
6. **Kill-Switch & Privacy Controls** – Ensures forensic analysts only have access when the victim consents.

## Who Benefits?

1. **Defenders of defenders** – Enables them to remotely collect spyware artifacts and detect compromise without risking physical device handover.
2. **Incident Response Helplines** – Allows digital security helplines to assist victims remotely by securely linking their device to forensic analysts.
3. **Threat Researchers & Public Interest Technologists** – Helps decentralized threat research groups break the monopoly of closed-source forensic expertise.
4. **Forensic Analysts** – Provides a streamlined forensic pipeline, eliminating the need for manual artifact collection via USB.

## Get Involved

MVT-Mesh is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from the community. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or civil society organization, there are many ways to get involved:

1. **Follow the project on GitHub**
2. **Contribute to the codebase**
3. **Test the solution in your organization**
4. **Share feedback and suggestions**

Together, we can ensure that no journalist, activist, or human-rights defender is left without the technical support they need to protect themselves against digital threats.
