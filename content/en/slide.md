We are a non-profit collective of public interest technologists working within and for civil society. The mission is to create an ecosystem where we can empower and build resilience for public-interest technologists. Providing them with the tools, knowledge, and autonomy to investigate digital threatsâ€”without relying on bottlnecks, big-Tech or proprietary, closed-source solutions.
